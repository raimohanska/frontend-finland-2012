Functional Reactive Programming in Javascript
==================================
Frontend Finland 2012 April Event

This is the material that I showed in my presentation on 2012-04-11 in
the Frontend Finland April Event 2012. The material consists of

- `slides.md` : my [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff) introductory presentation
- `start.html` : the web page for the live coding part
- `start.js` the starting point of the javascript that I coded in the
  live coding part
- `finalresult.html` the web page showing the final result of the live
  coding part
- `finalresult.js` the final result of the live coding part 

The live coding part was done using [bacon.js](https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js).
